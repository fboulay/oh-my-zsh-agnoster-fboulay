= agnoster-fboulay.zsh-theme


A theme forked from
https://github.com/fcamblor/oh-my-zsh-agnoster-fcamblor[agnoster-fcamblor]

A ZSH theme optimized for people who use:

* Solarized
* Git
* Unicode-compatible fonts and terminals (I use iTerm2 + Menlo)

For Mac users, I highly recommend iTerm 2 + Solarized Dark

== Install

=== Local install to oh-my-zsh

Run `install.sh` script to copy theme to your `~/.oh-my-zsh` folder

=== Install with Antigen

Add to you `.zshrc` the command `antigen theme fboulay/oh-my-zsh-agnoster-fboulay agnoster-fboulay`

== Compatibility

*NOTE:* In all likelihood, you will need to install a
https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline-fonts[Powerline-patched font] for
this theme to render correctly.

To test if your terminal and font support it, check that all the
necessary characters are supported by copying the following command to
your terminal: `echo "⮀ ± ⭠ ➦ ✔ ✘ ⚡"`. The result should look like this:

Example]

=== What does it show?

* If the previous command failed (✘)
* User @ Hostname (if user is not DEFAULT_USER, which can then be set in
your profile)
* Current time
* Free RAM
* Working directory
* Git statuses
** Dirty working directory (orange / green)
** Branch (⭠) or detached head (➦)
** Current branch / SHA1 in detached head state
** Remote branch name (if you're tracking a remote branch)
** Number of commit ahead HEAD and behind remote tracking branch (remote
tracking segment will be magenta if merge/rebase is needed)
